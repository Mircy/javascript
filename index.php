                            <p>&quot;It is now highly feasible to take care of everybody on Earth at a higher standard of living than any have ever known. It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary. War is obsolete. It is a matter of converting the high technology from weaponry to livingry.&quot;</p>

					<p>Our guts are long - like that of herbivores, which are designed to digest vegetation. The guts of carnivores are short to enable them to expel decomposing meat residues quickly. Meat is full of toxins from the animal at the time of death, and these toxins can be absorbed into the blood, contributing to all sorts of disorders, including headaches, arthritis, cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Because we do not have a digestive system designed to cope with meat, our health will suffer if we eat it.</p>
					<p>This is one theory. It is not bullet proof. There are many other theories, in fact there's an abundance of theories floating about... And so the debate on what is 'natural' food for our own rather unnatural species (seemingly void of instinct and unable to fit into any natural biotope of the planet) rages on, all whilst famine and diseases and cancer haunt our species at an accelerated rate. In the search for solid evidence of what is supposedly good for human health and longevity proper evidence remains lucid and theoreticall, where as the antagonists are quite obvious:</p>
					<p class="boldtext">What is bad:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Since 1940 we have released more than 140 000 substances into the atmosphere. 3 % of these have been researched. These affect the air, the water, the soil, plantlife, what we eat, what we drink, and us.</li>
						<li>Majority of the modern world depend on money and grocery stores to sustain themselves: In effect this means our species has domesticated a few wild plants and made them dull through mono-cropping, hybridization, pesticides and gene-manipulation, only to ship them half a world away - soaked in conservational chemicals and wrapped in plastic, containing no more than a ghost of all the nutrients you would find in their wild ancestors.</li>
						<li>As our immune systems inevitably break down from lousy food we develop diseases and we need medicines, another plant source is gathered, concentrated in the form of pills or liquid, sterilized, wrapped in plastic, labelled, and shipped half over the world. Basically our whole species herded into neat little rows running back and forth between the grocery stores and the hospitals. This is a short term solution which promotes population control, rather than long term health.</li>
						<li>With a rapidly growing global population and an increasingly unpredictable climate, food security has become a serious concern. There are over 20.000 species of edible plants known in the world, yet fewer than 20 species now provide 90% of our food. Yet as mono-cropping, pesticides and biochemistry backfires over and over again, even more resources are pushed into the same old machinery, wreaking havoc upon our natural biotopes. Rather than establishing sustainable food production systems we are escalating into a fullscale war on mother nature. The outcome of such a strategy is as predictable as it is insane as it is fatal.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Fortunately the solution is simple: Any halfwit of a decent intellect knows that the key  to dealing with problems is not through solutions, but to avoid creating problems in the first place: I.e. prevention! - Imagine a fraction of all the money invested in weapons technology, genetic seed research, Hollywood, bad reality shows, and the fashion industry - to the research and public education on the other 19.980 edible plants surrounding us: Free food and medicine for everyone.</p>
					<p>But since the control apparatus obviously figures Utopia a bad monetary investment it is up to us little people to gather and share knowledge, inspire and create, and hopefully one day redirect our task-incompatible leaders towards a new task; To convince them that the outmost aim of humanity need not be to control the human being, but to set her free!</p>
					<p>This is my contribution.</p>
				</div>
				<footer>
					<p class="boldtext">Thus, the aim of this site is:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>To present a list of wild edibles in the region I live, as well as describing their edible and medicinal uses. </li>
						<li>To create a practical blueprint on how to set up a small scale garden using the most common edible- and medicinal- plants that are either perennial or invasive, to allow for anyone with access to a small patch of land to approach self sustainability at the expense of little or no maintenance.</li>
						<li> To reduce the distance food and medicine has to travel (from that of another continent to your backyard), hopefully decreasing the abuse of fossil fuels and improve population health in the process.</li>
						<li>Make the world a slightly less horrible place.</li>
